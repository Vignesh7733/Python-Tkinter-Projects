## Project Name
Apple Quality Prediction GUI Application  
## Tools
Jupyter Notebook, PyCharm
## Programming Language
Python
## GUI Framework
Tkinter
## Machine Learning Model
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
## Libraries Used
.Joblib – For loading the trained ML model
.Tkinter – For the graphical user interface
Messagebox – For displaying results and alerts
## Methodology
Trained the KNN model with apple quality data.
Processed user input dynamically.
Displayed the predicted quality using a pop-up message.

## Project Description
This project is a desktop application that predicts the quality of apples based on user-input attributes such as size, weight, sweetness, and crunchiness. Leveraging a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) machine learning model, the application provides real-time quality predictions ( "good" or "bad"). The intuitive graphical user interface (GUI) is built using Python’s Tkinter library.
